## Description

My motivation for this project was to provide a simple solution to a tedious problem. I wanted to speed up the process of generating README markdown files and help others ensure that they are thorough with the information they provide. It can be time consuming to create a reade me for after every assignment, especially after finishing an extensive coding assignment. The last thing you want to do is spend more time worrying about formatting and other details. It is a timesaver so you can complete your task faster and focus on boosting your productivity in other areas. Through building this project I learned all about node modules, npm packages/dependencies, etc.
